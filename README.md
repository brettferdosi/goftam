# goftam

Work in progress transliterating input method for macOS. Currently Persian is
supported, but it is relatively straightforward to add other languages and
scripts.

The default input keyboard layout is set to the most recently used
ASCII-capable keyboard layout.

TODO
- add a dictionary pass to prioritize real words
- use Artifical Intelligence Machine Learning Big Data technology to improve
  candidate suggestions
- add debug statements and tests for the transliteration engine
- shift+space bypass (maybe)
- add a timeout for long searches
